    " Youth vaping has become a significant health issue over the last two decades, one that has been made more complicated due to differing state policies across the country. To gain a better understanding, our project aims to establish a correlation between state regulations and the usage of vapes and e-cigarettes among youth, ages 11 to 18, per state by assessing factors such as self-reported vape usage, quit attempts, and social media sentiment about vaping. By doing so, our data seeks to uncover whether the enforcement of these regulations contribute to overall reduction in vape usage. \n",
    " \n",
    "Our background addresses the serious health implications of vaping, challenging the widespread misconception that it is harmless and non-addictive. To do so, we will examine national usage trends to highlight the scope of youth vaping and analyze the influence of industry marketing and advertising, in addition to the role of education and income in shaping tobacco use patterns. Lastly, we will review prior research to identify the gap that our study addressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of health risks associated with smoking cigarettes that have been studied extensively but vaping is relatively new. In fact, the e-cigarettes that are currently available on the U.S. market have not been systematically reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their long-term effects on lung health. Neither of the two is considered safe, but since there are a lot of unknown factors in vaping, people turn a blind eye. Public health organizations such as the American Lung Association have expressed serious concern that e-cigarettes pose significant risks to respiratory health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both smoking and vaping pose serious health risks as they expose users to harmful chemicals that can cause irreversible lung damage and diseases. In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a consensus report that reviewed more than 800 studies on e-cigarettes and their effects. This report concluded that e-cigarette use is associated with clear health risks and that these products both contain and emit potentially toxic substances. The report also found moderate evidence that youth who use e-cigarettes experience increased coughing, wheezing, and asthma exacerbations.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, most cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance that is especially damaging for young adults and adolescents whose brains are still developing. Nicotine use in youth can negatively affect attention, learning, mood and impulse control, and mental health, leading to heightened stress, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation (Patten Par 6). <a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exposure risks extend beyond direct use. Both the U.S. Surgeon General and the National Academies have warned that secondhand e-cigarette emissions contain nicotine, ultrafine particles, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and flavoring chemicals such as diacetyl that have been linked to serious lung disease. These findings suggest that vaping can pose health risks not only to users but also to those exposed indirectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Nation Youth Tobacco Survey, there was a drastic 1000% increase in the amount of high school students who used disposable vapes from 2019 to 2020 <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). A prominent reason why children and teens are more inclined to try vaping products is because they are easily accessible and concealable. Despite FDA regulations intended to discourage teens and young adults from vaping, current policies only target specific devices and flavors, making it easy for the industry to circumvent these restrictions by inventing new flavors, new names, and new products that are not yet regulated in order to continue selling nicotine products to kids. What’s more, children and teens can easily purchase these products online or in stores, where age verification is often not required. As of now, young people are more likely to become addicted to nicotine through vaping rather than smoking cigarettes, a major shift from previous generations.\n",
    "\n",
    " Smoking and vaping has been a prevalent topic among both children and young adults as cigarettes become less appealing to the younger generation. Instead, vapes are being marketed by the industry as a safer and fun alternative to cigarettes, often advertised alongside fun fruity flavors and small, easily concealable devices. As a result, the Youth Risk Behavior survey shows that the percentage of teenagers who smoke cigarettes have significantly dropped from “70% in 1991 down to 58.4% in 2003 and even further down to 28.9% in 2017”(Jones, Salzman, par 2).<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Given this data, it’s easy to assume that the increase in anti-smoking advocacy and decades long research on cigarettes has successfully influenced teenagers and young adults to quit smoking. \n",
    " \n",
    "However, these figures only show one side of the story. With the invention of new e-cigarettes and vape products, a study published by Stanford University found that out of the 4351 participants,  2167 of them used vapes and e-cigarettes, with some participants being as young as thirteen years old. That’s almost 50% of participants that smoke, with two thirds still under the minimum legal age of 21. As more youth are gaining access to vapes and e-cigarettes, there is a higher risk of forming life long habits and addiction to nicotine. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes vaping so enticing is the way it's marketed to teens and young adults. Advertisements with bright colors or fun visuals are quick to draw in a younger audience. An increase in social media is also helping in widespread advertising of nicotine products. According to the research paper Exposure to e-cigarette advertising and young people's use of e-cigarettes: A four country study the “majority (85%) of respondents who had heard of e-cigarettes reported being exposed to e-cigarette advertising on at least one type of media” (Jones, Santos, et al).<a name=\"cite_ref-10\"></a>[<sup>10</sup>](#cite_note-10) Even with certain restrictions in different states, the access of social media and vape shops continues to expose young people to nicotine. In a similar paper titled The vaping epidemic in adolescents, advertisements of fun flavors such as “mint to gummi bear to frosted sugar cookie” (Jones, Salzman par 5),<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) are made to target younger audiences. Teens say that flavor is the most important factor and catering to their tastes with new flavors is the primary reason they try vapes. On top of that new vapes come in cool packaging and can be customised to your liking, some including screens on the sides. Widespread media and targeted flavors and aesthetics are a leading cause in the increase of teen vaping. \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the number of youths reported using e-cigarettes have increased with 1.63 million reporting usage in 2025. Vaping habits can be influenced through different social and demographic factors. According to the American Lung Association (ALA), those who have an undergraduate degree have a smoking rate of 4.4% compared to those with a high school degree with the rate of 14.7% and 18.3% for those who did not graduate high school. However, education isn’t the only factor that may contribute to increased smoking rates. Household income has the same effect. Youth in high income families are 28% more likely to view vaping as harmful in comparison to those from lower income families.  <a name=\"cite_ref-9\"></a>[<sup>9</sup>](#cite_note-9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the studies described above primarily focus on adult participants from a specific state. When they do address vaping among youth, the analysis is often concentrated on only one factor that impacts youth vaping rates. Our project aims to encompass teenage usage, from between the ages of 11 to 18, across all states to gain a nationwide overview. We also plan to look at a variety of regulations that impact youth vaping rates, like retail license regulations, age restrictions, and more. By doing so, we may uncover the reason behind early vape usage and implement better preventative measures to reduce the overall usage, a pressing concern that past studies have often overlooked. \n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "> Our data was taken from online sources so this did not concern us.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> During data collection, we are making sure to include data from different sources that may or may not support our conclusion. We are trying not to include data that might bias our results, such as data from organizations that might be promoting vaping. Additionally, all of our data comes from different credible sources, helping to reduce any bias that might be present in a single source.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Some of our data includes information from individuals, such as their vaping habits or plans to quit vaping. However, our datasets do not include any personally identifiable information, such as names or addresses. No personally identifiable information will be exposed through our data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> To test our downstream results, we will make use of any demographic information that is included in the datasets that we are using. Using the protected group status data that we have access to, we will check whether our analysis produces unequal outcomes across groups or whether one group is classified in a particular way more often than others. We will make sure to only use protected group demographic data for our downstream bias analysis, and not throughout our project as a form of discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> All of our data is publicly available from the internet. It does not include personal or sensitive information that needs to be secured. Since this information is public, we can't delete or remove information from the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> When brainstorming about this project, we tried to think about all the different factors that can come into play when it comes to influencing youth vaping. Our analysis includes how peers, education levels, household income and more can possibly have an impact on this.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "From the data we’ve examined, we’ve continuously kept bias in mind. Not all youth are being represented in each state or county and other factors can also have strong effects on causing young adults to vape. Some factors such as mental health, home environments and vaping laws in different states/counties are all limitations that may not be represented in the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> The data we have collected are all publicly available from other studies conducted by different organizations. This means the participants remain anonymous and no personal information will be displayed for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> It is important to document the process of our analysis for further research in the future. This can make it more clear on potential errors or updated analysis we find along the way or other research groups findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We will be careful not to use variables that could unfairly stand in for protected characteristics. Factors such as income, education, or location will only be used to look at overall trends and policy effects, not to judge individuals or specific groups of people.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> When possible, we will check whether our results differ across demographic groups. If differences appear, we will discuss them and consider how social or structural factors may explain these patterns rather than assuming they reflect differences between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We chose metrics like youth vaping rates, quit attempts, and sentiment scores because they directly relate to our research question. We understand that one metric alone may not tell the full story, so we will look at multiple measures when analyzing our results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> We will use simple and interpretable methods, such as correlations and regression models, so that our findings can be clearly explained. This helps ensure that our conclusions are easy to understand and not misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will clearly explain the limits of our analysis, including the use of self-reported data, differences in how policies are enforced across states, and the fact that our results show relationships rather than cause-and-effect. These limitations will be clearly stated in the final  report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> If users are harmed by the results of our data analysis, our organization will be open to any feedback or suggestions to improve upon our conclusion and ensure that all users are fairly represented. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> Since our data will incorporate information on specific demographics, including age, gender, income, education, and geography, we plan to analyze how such factors may contribute to the likelihood of vape usage among youth. It should be noted that we do not intend to discriminate against or stereotype those from certain backgrounds, as our research is purely from an academic and empathic perspective, one that aims to address and eliminate nicotine addiction among all youth. In doing so, those from underfunded and underrepresented communities may receive equal attention and funding to ensure that all children are given the tools and support necessary to lead healthy, fulfilling lives.
