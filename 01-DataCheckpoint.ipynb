Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "> Our data was taken from online sources so this did not concern us.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> During data collection, we are making sure to include data from different sources that may or may not support our conclusion. We are trying not to include data that might bias our results, such as data from organizations that might be promoting vaping. Additionally, all of our data comes from different credible sources, helping to reduce any bias that might be present in a single source.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Some of our data includes information from individuals, such as their vaping habits or plans to quit vaping. However, our datasets do not include any personally identifiable information, such as names or addresses. No personally identifiable information will be exposed through our data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> To test our downstream results, we will make use of any demographic information that is included in the datasets that we are using. Using the protected group status data that we have access to, we will check whether our analysis produces unequal outcomes across groups or whether one group is classified in a particular way more often than others. We will make sure to only use protected group demographic data for our downstream bias analysis, and not throughout our project as a form of discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> All of our data is publicly available from the internet. It does not include personal or sensitive information that needs to be secured. Since this information is public, we can't delete or remove information from the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> When brainstorming about this project, we tried to think about all the different factors that can come into play when it comes to influencing youth vaping. Our analysis includes how peers, education levels, household income and more can possibly have an impact on this.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "From the data we’ve examined, we’ve continuously kept bias in mind. Not all youth are being represented in each state or county and other factors can also have strong effects on causing young adults to vape. Some factors such as mental health, home environments and vaping laws in different states/counties are all limitations that may not be represented in the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> The data we have collected are all publicly available from other studies conducted by different organizations. This means the participants remain anonymous and no personal information will be displayed for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> It is important to document the process of our analysis for further research in the future. This can make it more clear on potential errors or updated analysis we find along the way or other research groups findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We will be careful not to use variables that could unfairly stand in for protected characteristics. Factors such as income, education, or location will only be used to look at overall trends and policy effects, not to judge individuals or specific groups of people.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> When possible, we will check whether our results differ across demographic groups. If differences appear, we will discuss them and consider how social or structural factors may explain these patterns rather than assuming they reflect differences between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We chose metrics like youth vaping rates, quit attempts, and sentiment scores because they directly relate to our research question. We understand that one metric alone may not tell the full story, so we will look at multiple measures when analyzing our results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> We will use simple and interpretable methods, such as correlations and regression models, so that our findings can be clearly explained. This helps ensure that our conclusions are easy to understand and not misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will clearly explain the limits of our analysis, including the use of self-reported data, differences in how policies are enforced across states, and the fact that our results show relationships rather than cause-and-effect. These limitations will be clearly stated in the final  report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> If users are harmed by the results of our data analysis, our organization will be open to any feedback or suggestions to improve upon our conclusion and ensure that all users are fairly represented. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> Since our data will incorporate information on specific demographics, including age, gender, income, education, and geography, we plan to analyze how such factors may contribute to the likelihood of vape usage among youth. It should be noted that we do not intend to discriminate against or stereotype those from certain backgrounds, as our research is purely from an academic and empathic perspective, one that aims to address and eliminate nicotine addiction among all youth. In doing so, those from underfunded and underrepresented communities may receive equal attention and funding to ensure that all children are given the tools and support necessary to lead healthy, fulfilling lives.
